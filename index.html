                  <p>
                    Hackathons are where your crazy idea becomes reality. Students work in teams for 24 hours to create something amazing. Build anything&mdash;there are no restrictions on what you can create. Dive in and make the most incredible thing you can alongside fellow creators.

                  <p>
                    All high school students from any high school are eligible. Unfortunately, we are unable to allow middle school students to attend this year.

                  <p>
                    All students regardless of coding ability are welcome. Hackathons are a great place to learn, so come and build your first app or website! We'll also have workshops for you to learn something new.

                  <p>
                    We highly encourage you to build with a team. Teamwork is deeply rooted in the hacking ethos, and you'll have a better time building with your brightest peers. Teams should be at most five people. But don’t worry if you don’t have a team before the event—we will have a team-formation session Friday night.

                    GunnHacks will cost you zero, zil, nada. We will provide you with WiFi, meals, swag, and workspace for the entire event. You just need to get here.

                  <p>
                    No problem! Many hackers do not have a fully-formed team or hack concept before the event begins. We will be hosting team-forming activities after hacking begins to help you find the perfect match. If you're a first-time hacker, there will be many others looking for team members with whom you can work.
