\section*{GunnHacks 2.0 Important Information}

GunnHacks 2.0 is this weekend! We're excited, and hope you are, too. Please take a look at the following document for logistical information that you should be aware of.

\subsection*{Venue \& Getting Here}

GunnHacks 2.0 will be at Henry M. Gunn High School at 780 Arastradero Rd, Palo Alto, CA 94306 in the N building. There will be GunnHacks volunteers in the parking lot guiding you to where you need to go. Also, see \href{https://gunnhacks.com/map.pdf}{the annotated campus map}.\\

Of note, if you plan on taking Caltrain, the closest station is Palo Alto's California Avenue, not University. Cal Ave is approximately a 30 minute walk to Gunn.\\

If you're driving, there will be afternoon traffic. Plan accordingly.\\

During the hackathon you can park in any of the main student lots for free without a permit. You cannot, however, park in the staff or otherwise reserved spots. There should be tons of space. Drop off is easiest from the back side\slash Miranda drop off.

\subsection*{Schedule}

GunnHacks 2.0 will run from 7 pm Friday, March 25 to 7 pm Saturday, March 26.\\

Check-in for hackers starts at 6:30 pm. You will need to have your current student ID or other equivalent as well as the signed photo\slash media release form. You will be expected to sign the GunnHacks Code of Conduct at registration.\\

The updated schedule can be found on \href{https://gunnhacks.com}{our website}. We will have tons of fun events and workshops throughout the hackathon.

\subsection*{Waivers}

You have already read and agreed to \href{http://static.mlh.io/docs/mlh-code-of-conduct.pdf}{the MLH Code of Conduct and Data Sharing Provision} during registration. You will also need to read \href{https://gunnhacks.com/code.pdf}{the GunnHacks Code of Conduct}, which you will be asked to sign for during registration. You also need to sign and bring a completed \href{https://gunnhacks.com/waiver.pdf}{photo\slash media release} with both your and your parent's signatures (if you're a minor).

\subsection*{In-and-Out Privileges}

You will be allowed to leave and enter as you wish, as long as you check in with the registration desk.

\subsection*{Communication}

We will be sending out a couple of emails during the event, so make sure you check your spam and ``Promotions''.\\

On top of that, we will be using Slack. You should have received an invite on Thursday. If you did not, you can get one from \href{https://slack.gunnhacks.com}{our slackin}.\\

You can also join \href{https://www.facebook.com/events/1706103592980386/}{our Facebook event} and follow us on \href{https://www.facebook.com/GunnHacks}{Facebook} and \href{https://twitter.com/GunnHacks}{Twitter} for updates.
